# Technical Debt Analysis and Remediation

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/codebase-cleanup-tech-debt` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Technical Debt Analysis and Remediation You are a technical debt expert specializing in identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing technical debt in software projects. Analyze the codebase to uncover debt, assess its impact, and create actionable remediation plans.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Context, Requirements, Executive Summary, Key Risks, Proposed Actions, Refactoring Guide.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Working on technical debt analysis and remediation tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for technical debt analysis and remediation
- The task is unrelated to technical debt analysis and remediation
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: You are a technical debt expert specializing in identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing technical debt in software projects. Analyze the codebase to uncover debt, assess its impact, and create acti.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Duplicated Code
2. Exact duplicates (copy-paste)
3. Similar logic patterns
4. Repeated business rules
5. Quantify: Lines duplicated, locations
6. Complex Code
7. High cyclomatic complexity (>10)

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

### 1. Technical Debt Inventory

Conduct a thorough scan for all types of technical debt:

**Code Debt**
- **Duplicated Code**
  - Exact duplicates (copy-paste)
  - Similar logic patterns
  - Repeated business rules
  - Quantify: Lines duplicated, locations

- **Complex Code**
  - High cyclomatic complexity (>10)

**Testing Debt**
- **Coverage Gaps**
  - Untested code paths
  - Missing edge cases
  - No integration tests
  - Lack of performance tests
  - Quantify: Coverage %, critical paths untested

- **Test Quality**
  - Brittle tests (environment-dependent)
  - Slow test suites
  - Flaky tests
  - No test documentation
  - Quantify: Test runtime, failure rate

**Documentation Debt**
- **Missing Documentation**

  - Quantify: Undocumented public APIs

**Infrastructure Debt**
- **Deployment Issues**
  - Manual deployment steps
  - No rollback procedures
  - Missing monitoring
  - No performance baselines
  - Quantify: Deployment time, failure rate

### 2. Impact Assessment

Calculate the real cost of each debt item:

**Development Velocity Impact**
```
Debt Item: Duplicate user validation logic
Locations: 5 files
Time Impact:
- 2 hours per bug fix (must fix in 5 places)
- 4 hours per feature change
- Monthly impact: ~20 hours
Annual Cost: 240 hours × $150/hour = $36,000
```

**Quality Impact**
```
Debt Item: No integration tests for payment flow
Bug Rate: 3 production bugs/month
Average Bug Cost:
- Investigation: 4 hours
- Fix: 2 hours
- Testing: 2 hours
- Deployment: 1 hour
Monthly Cost: 3 bugs × 9 hours × $150 = $4,050
Annual Cost: $48,600
```

**Risk Assessment**
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risk
- **High**: Performance degradation, frequent outages
- **Medium**: Developer frustration, slow feature delivery
- **Low**: Code style issues, minor inefficiencies

### 3. Debt Metrics Dashboard

Create measurable KPIs:

**Code Quality Metrics**
```yaml
Metrics:
  cyclomatic_complexity:
    current: 15.2
    target: 10.0

class PaymentFacade:
    def __init__(self):
        self.legacy_processor = LegacyPaymentProcessor()

    def process_payment(self, order):
        # New clean interface
        return self.legacy_processor.doPayment(order.to_legacy())

# Phase 2: Implement new service alongside
class PaymentService:
    def process_payment(self, order):
        # Clean implementation
        pass

# Phase 3: Gradual migration
class PaymentFacade:
    def __init__(self):
        self.new_service = PaymentService()
        self.legacy = LegacyPaymentProcessor()

    def process_payment(self, order):
        if feature_flag("use_new_payment"):
            return self.new_service.process_payment(order)
        return self.legacy.doPayment(order.to_legacy())
```

**Team Allocation**
```yaml
Debt_Reduction_Team:
  dedicated_time: "20% sprint capacity"

  roles:
    - tech_lead: "Architecture decisions"
    - senior_dev: "Complex refactoring"
    - dev: "Testing and documentation"

  sprint_goals:
    - sprint_1: "Quick wins completed"
    - sprint_2: "God class refactoring started"
    - sprint_3: "Test coverage >60%"
```

### 6. Prevention Strategy

Implement gates to prevent new debt:

**Automated Quality Gates**
```yaml
pre_commit_hooks:
  - complexity_check: "max 10"
  - duplication_check: "max 5%"
  - test_coverage: "min 80% for new code"

ci_pipeline:
  - dependency_audit: "no high vulnerabilities"
  - performance_test: "no regression >10%"
  - architecture_check: "no new violations"

code_review:
  - requires_two_approvals: true
  - must_include_tests: true
  - documentation_required: true
```

**Debt Budget**
```python
debt_budget = {
    "allowed_monthly_increase": "2%",
    "mandatory_reduction": "5% per quarter",
    "tracking": {
        "complexity": "sonarqube",
        "dependencies": "dependabot",
        "coverage": "codecov"
    }
}
```

### 7. Communication Plan

**Stakeholder Reports**
```markdown

#### Imported: Context

The user needs a comprehensive technical debt analysis to understand what's slowing down development, increasing bugs, and creating maintenance challenges. Focus on practical, measurable improvements with clear ROI.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @codebase-cleanup-tech-debt-v2 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @codebase-cleanup-tech-debt-v2 against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @codebase-cleanup-tech-debt-v2 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @codebase-cleanup-tech-debt-v2 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/codebase-cleanup-tech-debt`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
